"""Pure, dependency-light helpers shared by the gateway.

This module deliberately imports NOTHING from ``linuxcnc`` (or any other
machine-coupled binding) so it can be imported and unit-tested on a plain
developer machine — ``gateway.py`` itself does ``import linuxcnc`` at module
top and is therefore unimportable under pytest without the binding.

Keep this file pure: stdlib only, no side effects at import time.
